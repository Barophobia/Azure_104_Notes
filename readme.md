# My AZ-104 Notes

The Cert page can be found here: [AZ-104 Certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104)

Currently the breakdown of requirements are as follows:

- Manage Azure identities and governance (15–20%)
- Implement and manage storage (15–20%)
- Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20–25%)
- Configure and manage virtual networking (20-25%)
- Monitor and maintain Azure resources (10–15%)

The breakdown of notes are based on these requirements (Storage, Compute etc.).

## Efficient use

The content is very longform so I recommend finding a topic and searching through the relevant files using the browser function or cloning the repo and searching through the files.

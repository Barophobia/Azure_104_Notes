# My AZ-104 Notes

The Cert page can be found here: [AZ-104 Certification](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/certifications/exams/az-104)

Currently the breakdown of requirements are as follows:

- Manage Azure identities and governance (15–20%)
- Implement and manage storage (15–20%)
- Deploy and manage Azure compute resources (20–25%)
- Configure and manage virtual networking (20-25%)
- Monitor and maintain Azure resources (10–15%)

The breakdown of notes are based on these requirements (Storage, Compute etc.).

Due to azure being updated constantly it is best to look at the microsoft provided docs to get the latest information as some of the notes here may be out of date. Link: [Microsoft Docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/?product=popular)
